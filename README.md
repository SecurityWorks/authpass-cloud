# AuthPass Cloud

Backend application for [AuthPass Password Manager](https://authpass.app/).
Right now supports creating randomly generated email addresses which can
be used for sign up with services.

Right now users can generate arbitrary number of email addresses and can
retrieve all messages in those mailboxes. It is not (yet) possible
to reply from those addresses or forward them.

Basically. Not a lot to see here, move along. But make sure to check out 
[AuthPass](https://authpass.app/).
